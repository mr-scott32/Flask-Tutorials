# Flask Tutorials

This repository is to show an example of completed Flask tutorials to Year 10, 11 and 12 students. 

[The tutorials are available at this link](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world)

 I will add more instructions to this as I go.

## Changes to be Aware of

- #### **DO NOT** create a virtual environment
    - Unfortunately, due to students not having admin access, it is unlikely a virtual Python environment can be created. You will just need to work without one like I have. If you create one it WILL cause problems.

- Instead of 'flask run', use the following:

    - ```python -m flask run```
