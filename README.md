# Flask Tutorials

This repository is to show an example of completed Flask tutorials to Year 10, 11 and 12 students. 

Read the Markdown files in the `Tutorials` folder for instructions in making your Flask application.

[The tutorials these were based on are vailable at this link](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world)

 I will add more instructions to this as I go.

## To Be Aware Of

- #### **DO NOT** create a virtual environment
    - Unfortunately, due to students not having admin access, it is unlikely a virtual Python environment can be created. You will just need to work without one like I have. If you create one it WILL cause problems.

- Instead of 'flask run', use the following:

    ```bash 
    python -m flask run
    ```

- To enter debug mode, you'll need to type the following instead:
    ```bash
    python -m flask run --debug
    ```
