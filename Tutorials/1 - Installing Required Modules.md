Certainly! Here's how you can integrate `flask-wtf` into your installation steps for building a Flask application:

### Step 1: Installing Required Modules
Before you start building your Flask application, you need to install Flask, python-dotenv, and flask-wtf. Here’s how you can install these modules:

#### 1.1. Installing Flask
To install Flask, open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```bash
pip install flask
```

#### 1.2. Installing python-dotenv
Similarly, to install python-dotenv for managing environment variables, run the following command:

```bash
pip install python-dotenv
```

#### 1.3. Installing flask-wtf
To install flask-wtf for integrating WTForms with Flask, run the following command:

```bash
pip install flask-wtf
```

### Why These Libraries?

- **Flask**: Provides a micro web framework for Python, making it flexible and easy to use for web development.
- **python-dotenv**: Useful for loading environment variables from a `.env` file, ensuring your sensitive information is kept secure and separate from your codebase.
- **flask-wtf**: Integrates WTForms, a flexible forms validation and rendering library for Python, into Flask applications. It simplifies form handling and validation tasks.

### Example Output

After running these commands, you should see output similar to the following in your terminal:

```plaintext
Collecting flask
  Downloading Flask-2.0.2-py3-none-any.whl (95 kB)
     |████████████████████████████████| 95 kB 3.3 MB/s 
Collecting python-dotenv
  Downloading python_dotenv-0.19.2-py2.py3-none-any.whl (18 kB)
Collecting flask-wtf
  Downloading Flask_WTF-1.0.0-py2.py3-none-any.whl (13 kB)
Installing collected packages: flask, python-dotenv, flask-wtf
Successfully installed flask-2.0.2 flask-wtf-1.0.0 python-dotenv-0.19.2
```

Now that you have Flask, python-dotenv, and flask-wtf installed, you're equipped to build a Flask application with enhanced form handling capabilities using WTForms.
